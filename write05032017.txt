So I don't see any point writing this anywhere else other than directly into github.  This my idea - just like I walk every day and record how much I walk.  How about I write every day and record how much I write?

And just like with the walking, I could have a target - and a graph of how I'm doing.  Unlike with the walking I wouldn't have to actually write down how many words I did on any day because I could figure that out with a script.

If I do actually figure out how to run unix on my chromeos machine, then I'll probably go back to doing that.

It's clouding over here at Canary Wharf, so I'm not sure how much walking I'm going to do.  One thing that I've noticed with this keyboard is that it seems to make my wrists ache - which is something that I've never encountered before.  Maybe I'll get used to it.

And this is a very nice place to be sitting - I'm surrounded by hot women. Greeks at 2 o'clock, Turish women (I think) at 4 o'clock.  And Turkish waitresses all around the clock.  It's one of those places where the proprietor has hired the absolute hottest waiters that he can find. The first time that we came here the pies from here weren't all that good, but now, I don't know what's happened, they've got a *lot* better.
